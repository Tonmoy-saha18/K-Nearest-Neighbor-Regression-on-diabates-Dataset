# K-Nearest-Neighbor-Regression-on-diabates-Dataset
The k-nearest neighbors algorithm is a non-parametric classification method first developed by Evelyn Fix and Joseph Hodges in 1951, and later expanded by Thomas Cover. It is used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in data set.
